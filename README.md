# SOC-Lab (Home Security Operations Lab)

This project simulates a basic SOC environment using Splunk and Windows logs to detect suspicious activity.

# üîç What I Built
- Ingested Windows Event Logs and Sysmon into Splunk using a Universal Forwarder.
- Built dashboards to monitor:
  - PowerShell execution 
  - Windows logon failures (Event ID 4625)
  - Log ingestion trends over time

# ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
- Splunk Free Edition
- Universal Forwarder
- Sysmon
- Windows 11 (as the victim endpoint)
- Kali Linux (Hydra brute force login simulation)

# üì∏ Dashboards
- Suspicious PowerShell Activity
- Log Ingestion Breakdown
- Sysmon Event ID Volume Over Time

# üí° What I Learned
- How to simulate log events with attack tools (Hydra)
- Use of `spath`, `stats`, and `table` in SPL
- Creating dashboards and alerts in Splunk
